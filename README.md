BrowserSeizer
=============

# What is Browser Seizer and what it is purpose ?
Browser Seizer allows you to take into consideration the fact that you can already have a browser open and if even if that browser it's not the one selected as default on the system, it will open (in the already running browser) any link you clicked outside. Useful, because it avoids from having to launch one completely new instance of the default browser. 

Being all browsers nowadays memory hoggers, specially if you don't have a system with an abundance in memory, this small script can be useful from having to wait from the default to have to complete its entire launch.
